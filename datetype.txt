Document Object:
The Document Object represents the entire HTML document as a tree structure. It serves as an interface to manipulate and interact with the content within an HTML or XML document. Here are some crucial aspects of the Document Object:

Hierarchy and Structure:

The Document Object is structured as a tree, where each HTML element is a node.
It provides access to various elements, such as headings, paragraphs, forms, images, etc., through methods like getElementById() or getElementsByTagName().
Content Manipulation:

Developers use the Document Object to dynamically modify the content of a web page.
Methods like createElement(), appendChild(), and innerHTML allow for the creation and manipulation of HTML elements.
Event Handling:

The Document Object plays a crucial role in handling events such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
Event listeners can be attached to elements within the document using methods like addEventListener().
Window Object:
The Window Object, on the other hand, represents the browser window or a frame within a window. It acts as the global object for JavaScript in a web browser context. Let's delve into its distinctive features:

Global Scope:

The Window Object is at the top of the JavaScript object hierarchy and serves as the global object for all scripts running in a browser window.
Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword become properties of the Window Object.
Browser and Window Properties:

It provides information about the browser and the window, such as window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, and navigator.userAgent.
Methods like alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are part of the Window Object.
Navigation and Location:

The Window Object enables control over navigation with methods like window.open(), window.close(), and properties like window.location.
Key Differences:
Scope:

The Document Object operates within the scope of a specific HTML or XML document.
The Window Object has a broader scope, representing the entire browser window or frame.
Hierarchy:

The Document Object represents the structure of the document as a tree of elements.
The Window Object stands at the top of the hierarchy, encompassing the entire browser window.
Content vs. Browser Interaction:

The Document Object focuses on manipulating and interacting with the content within an HTML document.
The Window Object deals with broader browser-related functionalities, such as opening new windows, controlling navigation, and handling global events.
